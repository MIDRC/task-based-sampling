Task based sampling begins with the identification of cases relevant for a specific task and target population demographic characteristics (such as age range, COVID status, and imaging modality). Then, optimized quota sampling is conducted by randomly sampling cases until the maximum category margin (Baughan et al. 2022) is less than a pre-specified value. N. Baughan et al., “Task-Based Sampling of the MIDRC Sequestered Data Commons for Algorithm Performance Evaluation,” presented at Annual Meeting of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, 2022, E257–E258). 

This code has been developed and tested using MacOS 14.1.1, Matlab R2023b, and Microsoft Excel for Mac.
